\noindent These are the notes for my lectures on Ordinary Differential Equations for 1st-year
undergraduate physicists, taught in 2018-22 as part of Paper CP3 at Oxford. They also
include lectures on Normal Modes (part of Paper CP4), taught since 2021. I will be
grateful for any feedback from students, tutors, or (critical) sympathizers. The latest,
up-to-date version of this file is available at\\
